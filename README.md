# Foundations of High Performance Computing - Assignment 1
The present work has been done as part of assignement 1 of FHPC course at the University of Trieste. <br />
The whole project is structured in three subsections each of which is meant to investigate processes interaction on a HPC platform like ORFEO
(<a> https://orfeo-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ </a>). <br/>

The code for <i> Section 1 </i> was developed in C language and for message passing OpenMPI implementation has been used. <br/>
In <i>Section 2</i> both OpenMPI and Intel-MPI implementation are used and compared to estimate latency and bandwidth of
different networks using the Intel MPI benchmark.<br />
Finally, in <i> Section 3</i> the scalability of one Jacobi solver implementation is analyzed, 
checking for both strong and weak scalability with respect to the number of processors.
