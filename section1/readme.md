This section is splitted in two subfolders corresponding to the two parts 
to be developed: one for the ring exercise and the other for 3d matrix-matrix addition.

The code for both the subsections has been written in C and a simple Makefile
is provided to compile both the programs.

## Usage
```
make
```

To get rid of executables:

```
make clean
```
