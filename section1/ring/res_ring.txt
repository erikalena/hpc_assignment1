Non blocking implementation: 

I am process 0 and I have received 6 messages. My final messages have tag 0 and 0 and value 3, -3
I am process 2 and I have received 6 messages. My final messages have tag 20 and 20 and value -1, 1
I am process 1 and I have received 6 messages. My final messages have tag 10 and 10 and value 1, -1
Global amount of time taken by non blocking implementation to run on 3 processors is: 0.000007
